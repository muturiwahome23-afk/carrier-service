SRS Section: Non-Functional Requirements 
1. Performance (Latency)
The system must provide real-time updates to ensure logistics flow is not interrupted.

Requirement: The system shall process and reflect "Station Admin" updates (Vehicle ID and Time) across all user interfaces within 2 seconds of the data being committed to the database.

2. Scalability (Throughput)
The platform must handle growth in shipment volume and user traffic.

Requirement: The system architecture must support a minimum of 10,000 concurrent tracking requests and 500 simultaneous admin entries without a degradation in response time exceeding 10%.

3. Security (Data Protection)
Protection of sensitive user attributes is a legal and operational necessity.

Requirement: All PII (Personally Identifiable Information), including Sender/Receiver Names, Phone numbers, and IDs, must be encrypted using AES-256 standards both at rest and in transit (via TLS 1.3).

4. Availability (Uptime)
Logistics services operate around the clock; downtime results in physical shipment backlogs.

Requirement: The system shall maintain an availability of 99.9% (3-nines), ensuring that Senders and Receivers can access the "Parcel ID" lookup service 24/7.

5. Usability (Accessibility)
The interface must be accessible to users with varying levels of technical literacy.

Requirement: The user interface for Senders and Receivers must achieve a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80 or higher, ensuring that a Parcel ID search can be completed in under 15 seconds by a novice user.

6. Maintainability (Serviceability)
The system must be built so that developers can fix issues quickly without disrupting the whole chain.

Requirement: The system shall be developed using a modular or microservices architecture, allowing the "Station Admin" module to be updated or patched without taking the "Sender/Receiver" tracking portal offline.

7. Auditability (Traceability)
For the General Manager, knowing "who did what" is critical for resolving lost parcel disputes.

Requirement: The system must maintain an immutable audit log for every change made to a Parcel ID status, recording the Station Admin ID, the Vehicle ID used, and the exact timestamp of the modification.
